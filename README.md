#Simulation and Modelling User Group for the Language Sciences in Nijmegen

This repository is a playground for anyone attending the SMUG meetings.
Feel free to upload snippets of code (either through the GitHub.com website, the GitHub desktop client, or using git) that you want to share with others in the group.
If you have information other than code that you want to share, please make a page in the wiki! (I've started a list of information resources, you can link to your wiki page from there if you like.)

Have fun and see you at the meetings!
